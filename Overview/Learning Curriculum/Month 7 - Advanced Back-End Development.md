  - Review and recap of Month 7 content


Throughout Month 7, students will focus on advanced back-end development topics, including authentication, authorization, SQL databases, and API security. They will also learn best practices for documenting and testing their APIs. Additionally, students will explore deployment strategies and performance optimization techniques to ensure their applications are efficient and scalable. Practical projects and hands-on exercises will help students apply these concepts to real-world scenarios. 

By the end of Month 7, students should have a strong grasp of advanced back-end development principles and be well-prepared for more complex challenges in the following months.
