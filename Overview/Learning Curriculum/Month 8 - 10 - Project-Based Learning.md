Throughout Months 8 to 10, students will work on real-world projects, applying the knowledge and skills they've acquired in previous months. They will engage in the entire project lifecycle, from planning and ideation to implementation, testing, and deployment. Mentors and instructors will provide guidance and support, and students will participate in interactive workshops and live classes for project assistance and knowledge reinforcement.

By the end of this project-based learning period, students will have gained practical experience in full-stack development, working with industry professionals on meaningful projects. This experience will prepare them for real-world scenarios and help them build a strong portfolio to showcase their skills to potential employers or clients.
