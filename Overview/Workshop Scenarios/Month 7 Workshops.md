**Week 1 Workshop: Authentication and Authorization**

*Scenario 1: Implementing OAuth 2.0 for Social Login*
- Workshop Description: In this scenario, students will learn how to integrate OAuth 2.0 authentication for social login into a Node.js application. They will implement authentication with popular platforms like Google or Facebook and understand the OAuth flow.
- Workshop Objectives:
  - Set up OAuth 2.0 authentication.
  - Create routes and controllers for social login.
  - Handle user profile information.
  - Ensure security and authorization.

*Scenario 2: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)*
- Workshop Description: This workshop focuses on RBAC implementation. Students will create a system with different user roles and permissions. They will learn to restrict access to specific routes based on user roles and validate user actions.
- Workshop Objectives:
  - Design RBAC roles and permissions.
  - Implement middleware for authorization checks.
  - Secure API endpoints based on user roles.
  - Test role-based access control.

**Week 2 Workshop: SQL Databases and PostgreSQL**

*Scenario 3: Building a RESTful API with PostgreSQL*
- Workshop Description: Students will build a RESTful API using Node.js and PostgreSQL as the database. They will create endpoints for CRUD operations and explore SQL queries for data manipulation.
- Workshop Objectives:
  - Set up a PostgreSQL database.
  - Create RESTful API routes.
  - Perform SQL queries for data retrieval and manipulation.
  - Test the API using Postman or a similar tool.

*Scenario 4: Data Migration and Seeding with Knex.js*
- Workshop Description: In this workshop, students will work with Knex.js, a query builder for Node.js. They will learn to perform database migrations, which are essential for versioning database schema changes, and database seeding to populate initial data.
- Workshop Objectives:
  - Install and configure Knex.js.
  - Create and run database migrations.
  - Seed the database with sample data.
  - Understand the importance of database versioning.

**Week 3 Workshop: API Security and Best Practices**

*Scenario 5: Implementing API Rate Limiting*
- Workshop Description: Students will explore API rate limiting as a security measure to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of APIs. They will implement rate limiting middleware and test its effectiveness.
- Workshop Objectives:
  - Implement rate limiting middleware.
  - Define rate limits for different routes.
  - Test the API for rate limiting enforcement.
  - Handle exceeded rate limits gracefully.

*Scenario 6: API Documentation with Swagger*
- Workshop Description: In this workshop, students will create interactive API documentation using Swagger. They will learn how to define API endpoints, request and response schemas, and generate user-friendly documentation.
- Workshop Objectives:
  - Set up Swagger for API documentation.
  - Define API endpoints and models.
  - Generate interactive API documentation.
  - Showcase the importance of clear API documentation.

**Week 4 Workshop: Deployment and Hosting**

*Scenario 7: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with GitHub Actions*
- Workshop Description: Students will set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. They will automate the testing and deployment process for their Node.js application whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
- Workshop Objectives:
  - Configure GitHub Actions workflows.
  - Automate testing with each push.
  - Deploy the application to a hosting platform.
  - Monitor the CI/CD pipeline for errors.

*Scenario 8: Performance Optimization and Monitoring*
- Workshop Description: This workshop focuses on performance optimization and monitoring. Students will learn to use tools like New Relic or similar solutions to monitor their deployed applications and optimize performance.
- Workshop Objectives:
  - Set up performance monitoring tools.
  - Identify performance bottlenecks.
  - Optimize code and database queries.
  - Monitor application health and performance.

These scenarios will provide hands-on experience and practical skills to students during Month 7 of their advanced back-end development program. Each scenario addresses key topics in authentication, authorization, databases, API security, and deployment, ensuring that students are well-prepared for real-world development challenges.
